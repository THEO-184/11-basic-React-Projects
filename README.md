#How to Run Projects
git-clone this repo and run npm install to install or node_modules
Now Open App.js and change the import root directory of the project you want to run
Open index.js in the main scr folder and change the root directory of the index.css depending all the project root directory you chose at App.js.
This will choose the index.css for that project
Finally run npm start
